<h2><a name="ui300" id="ui300">How can I see older stories?</a></h2>
        <p>By scrolling down to the bottom of the page, you'll trigger the auto-more function, which will dynamically add stories to your page. It will do this twice, after which the page gets pretty big, so you can choose "Many more" to keep adding stories, or pick a particular day to see that day's stories.</p>

<h2><a name="ui200" id="ui200">What are Slashboxes? What can I do with them?</a></h2>
        <p>Slashboxes are the rectangular fields on the right hand side of the index that contain things like polls, a recent tag list, and a place to log in. They're dynamic, and you can click and drag the title bar to move them up and down. The X in the top right corner closes them. Reloading the page will bring back closed Slashboxes.</p>

<h2><a name="ui100" id="ui100">I want a Slashbox that does X</a></h2>
        <p>The policy for Slashboxes is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
                <li>The remote site gives us permission.</li>
                <li>The remote site provides an RSS feed URL.</li>
                <li>We decide that it belongs on Slashdot.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Currently the Slashbox contact address is <a href="mailto:help@slashdot.org">help@slashdot.org</a>. Email us your feed URL, as well as a technical contact, and we'll consider your addition to the roster.</p>

<h2><a name="ui400" id="ui400">What is the section menu for?</a></h2>
        <p>Each Slashdot story goes into one or more sections, determined by the tags and topics selected for that story. Clicking on a section will show you only stories related to that topic. You've also probably noticed that for some stories on the front page, only the titles are visible. These stories are only displayed in full if you're looking at that particular section, or if you click on the headline. We use this when we think the content is too specialized for the front page, but still think it's interesting enough to warrant a post. If a sectional story receives enough comments in a short period of time, it will be automatically promoted to the front page. Each of the section buttons has an edit icon, which you can use to change how they're displayed. You can change the active tab in which they're sorted (for example, changing Stories to Popular would give you the more interesting submissions that weren't posted), and you can add filter terms. Entering terms into the filter field also allows you to save custom sections, and you can subscribe to RSS feeds for any section.</p>

<h2><a name="ui600" id="ui600">How do I navigate Slashdot with keyboard shortcuts?</a></h2>

<p>Now you can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate Slashdot discussions as well as the index / firehose..  Mostly these have been designed for those of you who spend every waking moment on the site, but occasionally we get questions from people who rolled their head around on the keyboard and wondered why their page did silly things.  Here's a cheat-sheet, so you can get Slashdot's shortcuts into your muscle memory.</p>

<p>The keyboard shortcuts for the firehose are:</p>

<ul>
 
<li>Next firehose item: W/A/H/K
<li>Previous firehose item: S/D/L/J
<li>"Nod" (vote up) current item: +/=
<li>"Nix" (vote down) current item: -
<li>Open tagging box for current item: I/T
<li>Unfocus tag field: esc
<li>Toggle (open/collapse): Q/A/D
<li>Get more items: G
</ul>

<p>The keyboard shortcuts for the discussion system are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Previous/Next Comment (Following Threads) A/D
<li>Previous/Next Comment Sibling W/S
<li>Previous/Next Comment (Chronologically) Q/E
<li>Next Unread Comment: F

<li>Reply to Current Comment: R
<li>Parent of Current Comment: P
<li>Moderation Log of Current Comment: M (close with X)
<li>Skip to End: V
<li>Skip to Top: T
<li>Get More Comments: G
<li>Raise/Lower Abbreviation Threshold: [/]
<li>Raise/Lower Hide Threshold: ,/.
<li>Toggle D2 Floater Widget: /
</ul>

<p>Note that if you press a 'Next' key when you are at the end of a discussion will attempt to 'G'et more comments.  Also, holding down 'Shift' while using the navigation keys will hide the comment you just left.  So you can press 'shift-d' and leave the comments you have already read closed behind you as you read on.

<h2><a name="ui300" id="ui300">What does "Read More" mean?</a></h2>
        <p>What you see on Slashdot are summaries of interesting articles in various places on the web. Sometimes, there's just too much information to summarize while keeping individual stories reasonably short. In these cases, you'll see "Read X More Bytes..." Clicking on it will take you to the rest of the summary. Other times, we'll have original content, such as book reviews, game reviews, or freelance articles. These fall under the same category, and we usually try to mention that there's more to read. If it doesn't say there are "X More Bytes," then that just means the summary you see is complete. Clicking Read More will take you to the same place clicking the headline will -- a page where you can read user comments. </p>

		<h2><a name="ui300" id="ui300">What do these buttons by the header do?</a></h2>
        <p>At the top right, there are a handful of commonly used links. Clicking your username takes you to your personal page, where you can see recent comments and submissions you've made, as well as change your friend and foe settings. Subscribe takes you to where you can sign up for ad-free pages, and Journal goes to its own interface. Submit Story, Help, and Log Out are self-explanatory</p>
        <p>On the bar below that (the one with the tabs), you'll see |< and >| on the sides of the page, which are buttons that will hide the section menu and slashboxes, respectively. This lets you expand the stories to take up more real estate in your browser window. On the right side of the page, you'll also have a preferences icon to alter your firehose settings, and there is a play/pause button which governs whether or not your page will update dynamically.</p>

		<h2><a name="ui700" id="ui700">Why does "This Function Require JavaScript?"</a></h2>

<p>Welcome to the now, man!</p>

<p>Some elements of Slashdot's UI require the use of Javascript. In most cases we've provided backwards compatibility for the more paranoid folks in our crowd that are fearful of executing unknown code within their browsers, but sometimes it's just not practical to maintain a second UI for this. Right now this includes the customizable section menus, tagging, and a great number of user interface customization options. We know it's a potential security hazard, but sometimes you just have to jump out of the airplane to get that adrenaline rush. Try it sometime. Pack your own chute tho. </p>
