[% CASE 'new_user_open_proxy' %]
	According to our tests, you are trying to create an account 
	from an HTTP proxy that is open to the world.  Please close the proxy or
	ask your sysadmin to do so, because open proxies are used to spam web
	sites like this one. 

	<p>Feel free to contact [% constants.adminmail_ban %] if you have questions.

[% CASE 'mail_readonly' %]
	Sorry, you cannot use the "mail password" function from your

	this error, please email [% constants.adminmail_ban %]
	with your IPID, which is "[% user.ipid %]";
	a note that this is regarding an attempt to mail your password;
	and the name, uid, and email address of the account in question.

[% CASE 'mail_toooften' %]
	To prevent you from being harassed with email,
	[% constants.sitename %] limits you to

	sent to you every

	[% constants.sitename %] User Password for [% nickname %]

[% CASE 'mail_msg' %]

Your new password is [% newpasswd %].  Your old password will still work until
this password is used.  Go to the URL below to log in:

<[% gSkin.absolutedir %]/index.pl?op=userlogin&upasswd=[% newpasswd %]&unickname=[% tempnick | fixparam %]&returnto=%2Flogin.pl%3Fop=changeprefs>

Make sure you then CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD!

If you have received this message without having requested it, it is
because someone attempted to use your username or e-mail address.  It
was mostly likely an innocent mistake, and they are not getting your
password, so you can safely disregard this message.

Thanks.

In case you get multiple emails you didn't request, the requester's IP
was [% remote_ip %].[% IF user_agent %]  Its user agent was
"[% user_agent %]"
(not that you should trust that value, but it might be interesting).[% END %]
[% IF x_forwarded_for %]In case that's a properly-configured proxy,
the value of its X-Forwarded-For header was "[% x_forwarded_for %]" --
but don't trust that value unless you know a reason to (we don't).[% END %]

If you don't use this new password within [% constants.mailpass_valid_days %] days, it will expire
and you'll have to send yourself another one.
