Please run createachievements.pl after installing the Achievements plugin
if you want to use real site data immediately (rather than waiting for
achievements to propagate).

You can also re-run createachievements.pl at any time, but you should
probably do a hard reset of your achievements table (drop it and recreate,
or delete all DB rows).

achievements.pl should not be manually run at this time.
