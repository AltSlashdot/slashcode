New Subscribe Plugin.

Allows for PayPal processing using both Payment Data Transfer (PDT) and Instant Payment Notification (IPN). PDT allows for PayPal to send data back to the calling website immediatly after payment processing is competed by the buyer.  Once Slash gets the data, it completes the subscripton buying pocess by logging the purchase and updating the user's subscription.

This process relies on a proper redirect from PayPal to the Slash site.  Because this may fail, we also use IPN processing.  With IPN, PayPal sends a transaction to a listerner on the Slashe site (ppipn.pl). INP will continue to send the transaction until it is acknowledge by the ppipn.pl listener.  Once a transaction is recieved ppipn.pl will verify the payment has not alrealy been processed by the Slash PDT porcessor, it will add the payment and update the subscription.  

You must actvate each of these sysems in your Paypal business account for them to work with Slash.

Also the Subscribe Plugin requires the following CPAN modlues to be installed in Perl before it can be used:
	DateTime
	DateTime::Format::MySQL
	LWP::UserAgent
	Business::PayPal::IPN
