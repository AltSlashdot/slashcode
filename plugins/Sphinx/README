After doing install-plugin for the Sphinx plugin, you'll need to:

* install SphinxSE on at least one database (preferably reader,
  but writer will work)
* add a 'sphinx01' virtual user to DBIx/Password.pm, pointing to
  that database
* install Sphinx itself on the machine 'sphinx01' at least
* craft a sphinx configuration file (making use of sphinx_counter)
  to index the firehose (this is vital, but details are pending,
  sorry)
	- task to write this?
		yeah, write to /u/l/s/site/sitename/misc/sphinx_01.conf
	- vars (or small table?) for 'sphinx01' and each
	  additional sphinx instance:
		sql_user
		sql_pass (password)
		sql_db
		sql_host
		sql_port
		sql_sock
		sphinx_01_vardir: /srv/sphinx/var/
		sphinx_01_hostname: (same as sql_db, at least for now)
		sphinx_01_port: 3312
* run searchd, probably on the same machine 'sphinx01' points to
	- searchd --config /u/l/s/site/sitename/misc/sphinx_01.conf --iostats
* run indexer in a loop to constantly pick up new firehose changes
  (details pending)
* ALTER TABLE sphinx_search CONNECTION='sphinx://hostname:port/*';
  on the 'sphinx01' database, where host=searchd-hostname, post=searchd-listen
* set the 'sphinx' var to 1

After those steps are done,

my $sphinxdb = getObject("Slash::Sphinx", { db_type => "sphinx" });

and $sphinxdb->sqlSelect* will work to query the sphinx_search table.
