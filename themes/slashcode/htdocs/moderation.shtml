<h2>Slash Moderation</h2>
<p>This document will attempt to explain the moderation system that lies underneath our implementation of Slashcode's vast comment section.</p>
<p>This document was originally written for Slashcode</a>, but we built ours from the same moderation system. We've updated this document, but keep in mind that as we are growing, the specifics may be in flux..</p>
<h1>Contents</h1>
<ol><li>Purpose</li>
<li>Goals</li>
<li>Who</li>
<li>How</li>
<li>FAQ</li></ol>
<h1>Purpose</h1>As you might have noticed, a site like this can get a lot of comments. Some are down right terrible; but others are truly gems.
<p>The moderation system is designed to sort the gems and the crap from the steady stream of information that flows through the pipe. And wherever possible, it tries to make the readers of the site take on the responsibility.</p>
<p>The goal is that each reader will be able to read the the threshold they prefer. Select "-1" and you'll see trolls and possible wrongly-modded comments, try "5" and you'll see only the top-rated comments.</p>
<h1>Goals</h1>
<ol>
<li>Promote Quality, Discourage Crap</li>
<li>Make SoylentNews as readable as possible for as many people as possible.</li>
<li>Do not require a huge amount of time from any single moderator.</li>
<li>Do not allow a single moderator a 'reign of terror'</li>
</ol>
<h1>Who</h1>It's probably the most difficult part of the process: Who is allowed to moderate. On one hand, many people say "Everyone", but we've chosen to avoid that path because the potential for abuse is so great. Instead, we've set up a few simple rules for determining who is eligible to moderate.
<ol>
        <li><strong>Logged In User</strong> If the system can't keep track, it won't work, so you gotta log in. Sorry if you're paranoid, but this system demands a certain level of accountability.</li>
        <li><strong>Positive Contributors</strong> Slashcode tracks your "Karma" (see the FAQ). If you have non negative Karma, this means you have posted more good comments than bad, and are eligible to moderate. This weeds out spam accounts.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the end result is a pool of eligible users that represent (hopefully) average, positive SoylentNews contributors. Occasionally the system checks the number of comments that have been posted, and gives a proportionate amount of eligible users moderator points. This means that you'll need to be eligible in order to actually gain moderator access. It all works to make sure that everyone takes turns, and nobody can abuse the system, and that only "regular" readers become moderators.</p>
<h1>How</h1>When a moderator is given access, they are given a number of points of influence to play with. Each comment they moderate deducts a point. When they run out of points, they are done serving until next time it is their turn.
<p>Moderation takes place by selecting an adjective from a drop down list that appears next to comments. Descriptive words like 'Flamebait' or 'Informative'. Bad words will reduce the comments score by a single point, good words increase a comments score by a single point. All comments are scored on an absolute scale from -1 to 5. Logged in users start at 1 (although this can vary from -1 to 2 based on their overall contribution to discussions) and anonymous users start at 0.</p>
<p>Moderators can not participate in the same discussion as both a moderator and a poster. This is to prevent abuses, and while it is one of the more controversial aspects of the system, we're sticking to it. There are enough lurkers that moderate, that if you want to post, feel free.</p>
<p>Moderation points expire after 4 hours if they are left unused. You then go back into the pool and will be given access again another day.</p>
<p>Concentrate more on promoting than on demoting. The real goal here is to find the juicy good stuff and let others read it. Do not promote personal agendas. Do not let your opinions factor in. <strong>Try</strong> to be impartial about this. Simply disagreeing with a comment is not a valid reason to mark it down. Likewise, agreeing with a comment is not a valid reason to mark it up. The goal here is to share ideas. To sift through the haystack and find needles. And to keep the children who like to spam in check.</p>
<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>I just got moderator access, what do I do?</h2>The fact that you are reading this document proves that you are already on the right track.
<h2>Why can't I suddenly moderate any more?</h2>
<ul>
        <li>Moderator access only lasts 4 hours.</li>
        <li>You can't moderate and post in the same discussion.</li>
        <li>Do you still have any moderator points left?</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is a Good Comment? A Bad Comment?</h2>
<ul>
        <li>Good Comments are insightful. You read them and are better off having read them. They add new information to a discussion. They are clear, hopefully well written, or maybe amusing. These are the gems we're looking for, and they deserve to be promoted.(Score: 2-5)</li>
        <li>Average Comments might be slightly offtopic, but still might be worth reading. They might be redundant. They might be a 'Me Too' article. They might say something painfully obvious. They don't detract from the discussion, but they don't necessarily significantly add to it. They are the comments that require the most attention from the moderators, and they also represent the bulk of the comments.(Score: 0-1)</li>
        <li>Bad Comments are flamebait. Bad comments have nothing to do with the article they are attached to. They call someone names. They ridicule someone for having a different opinion without backing it up with anything more tangible than strong words. Bad comments are repeats of something said 15 times already making it quite apparent that the writer didn't read the previous comments. They use <strong>unnecessary</strong> foul language. They are hard to read or just don't make any sense. They detract from the article they are attached to.(Score: -1)</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Karma?</h2>Karma is the sum of all moderation activity done to a user. Karma is used to determine eligibility for moderator status and can affect your comments starting score. Every new user starts with a Karma of 0, and as long as your karma isn't <em>negative</em> you are eligible to become a moderator.
<h2>Why Don't I get my points back after I post in a discussion I moderated?</h2>Basically because of the following scenario:
<ol>
        <li>Bob Moderates a Discussion</li>
        <li>Bob Waits Until Tomorrow When the Discussion Leaves the Homepage and Activity Dies Off.</li>
        <li>Bob goes into dead discussion, posts and comment, reclaims his moderator points.</li>
        <li>Lather. Rinse. Repeat</li>
</ol><p>This scenario would easily allow a user to continue to have moderator access for as long as they felt like it. Simply disallowing the retrieval of points makes this impossible.</p>
<h2>How can I improve my Karma?</h2>
<p>What follows was originally a story submission by <a href="mailto:dkh2@po.cwru.edu">dkh2</a>. It seemed to me that it would better serve readers here: <strong>10 tips for improving your Karma:</strong></p>
<dl>
        <dt><strong>Post intelligently:</strong></dt>
        <dd>Interesting, insightful, thought provoking comments are rated higher on a fairly consistent basis.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Post calmly:</strong></dt>
        <dd>Nobody likes a flame war. In fact, more times than not the flamer gets burned much more than their target. "Flaim Bait" is hit quickly and consistently with "-1" by moderators. As the bumper sticker says... "Don't be a dick."</dd>
        <dt><strong>If you can't be deep, be funny:</strong></dt>
        <dd>If you don't have something truly developing to the topic, some humor is welcome. Humor is lacking in our lives and will continue to be promoted. Remember though, what rips your sides out may be completely inane to somebody else.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Post early:</strong></dt>
        <dd>If an article has over a certain number of posts on it already yours is less likely to be moderated. This is, less likely both statistically (there are more to choose from) and due to positioning (as a moderator I have to actually find your post waaay at the end of a long list.)</dd>
        <dt><strong>Post often:</strong></dt>
        <dd>If you only post once a month you can expect your karma to remain low. Also, lively discussion in an open forum is what makes Slashdot really "Rock the Casbah."</dd>
        <dt><strong>Stay on topic:</strong></dt>
        <dd>Off topic posts are slapped quickly and consistently with "-1" by moderators.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Be original:</strong></dt>
        <dd>Avoid being redundant and just repeating what has already been said. (Did I really just say that?) Yes, being moderated as "redundant" is worth "-1" to your post and your karma. Especially to be avoided are the "what he said" and "me too" posts.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Read it before you post:</strong></dt>
        <dd>Does it say what you really want it to say? Check your own spelling and grammar. Occasionally, a perfectly beneficial post is passed over by moderators because of this completely irrelevant to content feature. This is also a good approach to checking yourself for what you're really saying. Can't tell you the number of times I've stopped myself from saying the opposite of what I meant by checking my own s&amp;g.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Log in as a registered user:</strong></dt>
        <dd>I know, this sounds obvious but, "Anonymous Coward" does not have a karma rating. You can't reap the perceived benefits of your own accidental brilliance if you post anonymously. Have pride in your work and take credit for it.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Read Slashdot regularly:</strong></dt>
        <dd>You can't possibly contribute to the discussion if you're not in the room. Come to the party and play.</dd>
</dl>

<h1>Ideas for the Future</h1>This is a system in development. Things can change, our goal is to create one of the most comprehensive and well though-out moderation systems in existence. This is no small task. These proposals might make this the best system yet:
<ol>
<li>Integrating <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/" targe="new">SpamAssassin</a> into the comment system for ACs</li>
<li>Integrating a weighting system for ACs (annynomous comments) IP addresses: known ip addresses would be subject to Karma that can affect their initial post score</li>
</ol>
