# Post-slashcode 14.04 release
# Theme change
# (ok, this isn't technically a schema edit, *but* this file kinda acts as our general upgrade documentation
# We've got two new themes, replacing the old slashcode.com one; chillax which is our default theme, and soylentnews
# which is the main site (and inherts most the templates via voodoo in THEME file).
# When updating, the site_info table needs a quick update to point the site from "slashcode" to "soylentnews"
# then symlink-tool/template-tool should be run. I recommend deleting out all the templates from the database 
# as well 
#
# Once deleting the theme out, and installing the new "default" theme which is a giant catch-all, add a variable
# to control the default skin
ALTER TABLE users_info ADD COLUMN skin varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL;
INSERT INTO vars (name, value, description) VALUES ('default_skin','chillax','Default skin to use in-case the user has not selected one');

# New SoylentNews Slashcode updates 2014-06-01.
UPDATE vars SET value = 'slashcode_06_14' WHERE name = 'cvs_tag_currentcode';

# Allow submissions to have longer titles. story_text title is set to VARCHAR(100) so match here.
ALTER TABLE submissions MODIFY subj VARCHAR(100);

# Add new voting feel
# NOTE: this shouldn't be in users, but it makes audioguys job easy, and the schema
# is already fucking ugly as sin so ....
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN willing_to_vote tinyint UNSIGNED DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;

# Disable portscanning by default
INSERT INTO vars (name, value, description) VALUES ('enable_portscan','0','Enable portscanning of proxys');

# Setup Imporved Threaded comments
INSERT INTO commentmodes (mode, name, description) VALUES ('improvedthreaded','Impoved Threaded','');
ALTER TABLE users_comments CHANGE mode mode ENUM('flat','nested','nocomment','thread','improvedthreaded') DEFAULT 'improvedthreaded';
